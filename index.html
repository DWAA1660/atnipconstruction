		Jim Atnip builds on a long tradition of construction experience. Jim was 
		out framing a house when his high school class was graduating.&nbsp; Two 
		months later he found time to get back to school to pick up his 
		diploma.&nbsp; Jim continues to build 33 years later.&nbsp; During this time he 
		has worked as a superintendent for several large general construction 
		companies by superintending large commercial and industrial projects. &nbsp;</span></font></font></p>

		<span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; color: #800000">
		<font size="4">From the beginning, Jim realized that the special thing 
		about building was that whatever you built would still be there for 
		years to come. In other words, his signature would be on every project 
		he undertook, and the reputation of Atnip Construction would rise or 
		fall on the quality of his work and the satisfaction of his customers. 
		So when Jim started his homebuilding business he set out to build more 
		than just homes. He set out to build a reputation for integrity and 
		enduring workmanship. Atnip Construction team will draw their own plans, 
		but can also work from yours. Through the entire planning process, Jim 
		will guide your decisions about everything from the foundation up to the 
		roof. If you are thinking of building a new house, you should definitely 
		meet with Jim to discuss your building options. From start to finish, 
		you can be confident that everything built under the Atnip Construction 
		name will be personally signed with the ink of Jim's own reputation.
